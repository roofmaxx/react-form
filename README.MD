Installation Instructions
===

Step One: CSS and JS
===

Include the CSS and JS files in the head of your page:


CSS:
---

    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/roofmaxx/react-form/css/54bfa786.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

JS:
---

    <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/roofmaxx/react-form/js/7058a028.js"></script>


Step 2: HTML
===

Add this HTML element wherever you would to see the form on your page:

**Please note: you MUST include a value for data-dealer-id**

EXAMPLE 1:
---
A minimal example with a "dealer ID".  (If it isn't obvious, please note that you need to use your dealership's actual dealer ID here, not `123456789`)

    <div id="roofmaxx-form" data-dealer-id="123456789"></div>

EXAMPLE 2:
---
Same result as above, but we're explicitly passing empty values through for 'source vendor' and 'thank-you-page'

    <div id="roofmaxx-form" data-dealer-id="123456789" data-source-vendor="" data-thank-you-page=""></div>

EXAMPLE 3:
---
In this example, we are explicitly defining a 'source_vendor' and a 'thank-you-page'
This will not apply for most dealers, but some vendors may be able to use the 'source_vendor' feature.
If the thank-you data is left empty or omitted, the default is `https://roofmaxx.com/thank-you`

    <div id="roofmaxx-form" data-dealer-id="123456789" data-source-vendor="SG" data-thank-you-page="https://roofmaxxofsomewhere.com/thank-you"></div>
